1. Let the macarons dry completely! Even if the recipe says to put the macarons in the oven after 15 min minutes. This takes at least 30 min (with extra cornstarch added) where I live<br/>
2. Double check weight of ingredients! Don&rsquo;t have a dyslexic moment and weigh 150g of eggs whites when the recipe clearly calls for 105g #macaron #frenchmacaron #macarons #vscocam<br/>
